**Exp 4 : Explore Various Variable and Row Filters in R for Cleaning Data & Apply Plot Features on Sample Datasets**

**AIM:**
To explore and apply various row and column (variable) filters in R for cleaning data and visualize the results using different plotting functions.

**EQUIPMENTS REQUIRED:**
R Language (via RStudio or CLI)
Dataset: Iris dataset (URL)

**ALGORITHM:**
Load the dataset from a URL using read.csv().
Explore the structure and summary of the dataset.
Apply filters to rows and columns for cleaning/subsetting.
Visualize data using boxplots, histograms, and scatter plots.

**Program:**




**EXPECTED OUTPUT:**
**Note** : Upload the following screenshots of your output
The structure and summary of the dataset will be displayed in the console.
Filtered records with Sepal Length > 5.
Selected columns (Sepal Length and Petal Length).
Visualizations:
A boxplot for Sepal Width.
A histogram for Petal Length.
A scatter plot showing Sepal vs Petal Length with points colored by species.

**RESULT:**
Successfully filtered and visualized data loaded directly from a URL in R using built-in functions.
